# Resume PDF Generation Instructions

Since we cannot directly create PDF files in this environment, please follow these steps to create your resume PDF:

## Option 1: Using the HTML Resume (Recommended)

1. Open `assets/resume.html` in your browser
2. Press `Ctrl+P` (Windows) or `Cmd+P` (Mac)
3. Select "Save as PDF" as the destination
4. Save it as `resume.pdf` in the `assets` folder

## Option 2: Create Your Resume Online

Use one of these free online resume builders:

1. **Canva Resume Builder** - https://www.canva.com/create/resumes/
2. **Resume.io** - https://resume.io/
3. **Google Docs Resume Templates** - https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/
4. **Novoresume** - https://novoresume.com/

## Option 3: Use Microsoft Word or Google Docs

1. Use the information from `resume.html` 
2. Create a professional resume in Word/Docs
3. Export as PDF
4. Save as `assets/resume.pdf`

## Important:
After creating the PDF, name it exactly: `resume.pdf` and place it in the `assets` folder so the download button works correctly!

The download buttons are already configured to download: `assets/resume.pdf`
